Dataset : [Kaggle](kaggle.com/iashiqul/brain-tumor-mri-image-classification)

EfficientNetB0 is used to classify MRI Images into the following 5 classes:
1. No Tumor
2. Glioma Tumor
3. Meningioma Tumor
4. Pituitary Tumor

Skater Interpretabilty <br/>
LimeImageExplainer is used to superimpose the mask over the image to show the interpretabilty of the model.
